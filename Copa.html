        <p>The 2014 FIFA World Cup was a landmark event in recent Brazilian history, bringing both high expectations and
            significant challenges. It was the second time the country hosted the tournament, and preparations involved
            major investments in infrastructure, including stadium upgrades, airport improvements, and expanded public
            transportation networks.

            On one hand, the World Cup brought economic benefits such as increased tourism and temporary job creation in
            host cities. The global visibility also provided Brazil with an opportunity to showcase its vibrant culture,
            highlighting not just football but also its cultural diversity and the hospitality of the Brazilian people.

            However, the event also sparked criticism and controversy. Large-scale protests took place in several
            Brazilian cities before and during the World Cup, with demonstrators voicing concerns over excessive public
            spending and inadequate investments in priority areas such as healthcare and education. There were also
            concerns about displacements of local communities for stadium construction and associated infrastructure,
            raising questions about human rights and urban planning.

            Additionally, some of the stadiums built or renovated for the event faced post-World Cup challenges,
            including underutilization and high maintenance costs. These economic issues underscored broader debates
            about the sustainability of major sporting events and the legacy left for host cities.

            In retrospect, the 2014 World Cup was a complex chapter in Brazil's history, leaving a mixed legacy of
            achievements and challenges. The event demonstrated the country's capability to host global mega-events but
            also raised urgent questions about investment priorities, sustainable urban development, and social
            responsibility.</p>
